# The Lost Key.. 
# The untold story by vinnu.. hahaha.. read it please


Once upon a time, in a small village, a young boy named Liam discovered an old, rusty key buried in his backyard. 
Curious, he searched for the lock it might open. Days turned into weeks as he explored every corner of the village.
One day, he stumbled upon an abandoned cottage hidden in the woods. The key fit perfectly into the door. Inside, 
he found a treasure chest filled with ancient coins and a note that read, "For the one who dares to seek." Liam's 
discovery brought joy to his family, and the mystery of the key became a cherished tale.
